        <h4 class="section-title">WORK HISTORY</h4>
        <p><strong>Lambton College, Mississauga, Canada - Senior DevOps | Full Stack Software Development | Platform Engineer</strong> (May 2024 - Present)</p>
        <ul class="project-list">
            <li>Delivered a scalable, cloud-ready application while practicing the full range of software engineering,
                        DevOps automation, and platform engineering. This project bridges development and operations, ensuring faster
                        feature delivery, stable environments, and an improved developer experience.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Amdocs, Brazil - Senior DevOps engineer</strong> (Nov 2019 - Mar 2024)</p>
        <ul class="project-list">
            <li>Promoted after exceeding expectations on previous projects and transferred to Orange
                Spain, working with microservices in AWS and Kubernetes (EKS). Handling
                microservices deployment through Jenking. During the deployment process, I had to
                troubleshoot issues related to Kubernetes resources and YAML manifests provided by
                developers. I also managed Docker images, for example, removing unused images that
                were no longer in use.</li>
            <li>After the Orange project ended, I was assigned to the VIVO Brazil project due to my
                knowledge of legacy environments, continuing to monitor, deploy, and automate
                processes such as cleaning Linux filesystems using shell script and python.</li>
            <li>Later, I was invited to join AT&T due to my experience with microservices and
                problem-solving skills. On a daily basis, I was responsible for troubleshooting
                microservices environments and deploying these services using Jenkins. I debugged
                issues ranging from NoSQL Couchbase to PostgreSQL and Kafka messaging, fixed
                Kubernetes manifest configurations, and maintained and corrected cluster resources and
                configurations. In addition, I supported developers in troubleshooting Java Spring Boot
                microservices. For example, I identified an error in the pod logs related to certificates.
                The certificate used a wildcard in the Common Name (CN), which is not accepted by
                Java. After correcting the certificate, the application was up and running again.</li>
            <li>At AT&T, I led several initiatives, both with my team and individually, for process
                optimization of deployment of microservices environments using CI/CD Jenkins, such as
                creating a pipeline, using Bitbucket as the main SCM, to efficiently synchronize artifacts
                between test and production Nexus Artifactory for faster deployment of environments.
                Reducing deployment time by 60 percent.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>2Com Consulting, Brazil - NOC engineer</strong> (Jan 2018 - Nov 2019)</p>
        <ul class="project-list">
            <li>In the beginning, I was responsible for monitoring all the servers and helping my
                colleagues resolve issues by accessing the Linux servers, performing a full analysis,
                and sharing the results with them to continue the work.</li>
            <li>Over time, I became more self-sufficient and was assigned full responsibility for
                monitoring and resolving issues in an entire region of Brazil.</li>
            <li>Noticing that most problems were repetitive, with the same alerts and manual
                installation of monitoring plugins, I helped implement an automation tool called
                Ansible.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>TDM Network, Brazil - IT Infrastructure Support</strong> (Jan 2017 - Jan 2018)</p>
