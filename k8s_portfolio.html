        <h4 class="section-title">Professional Summary</h4>
        <p>DevOps engineer with solid experience in setting up and managing infrastructure,automating deployments, and fixing technical issues. I am skilled in using Python, Ansible, Shell scripting, and Jenkins to make deployments easier and reduce manual
        tasks. Experienced in setting up and managing Kubernetes environments.
        For example, I worked on a personal project (Monitoring cluster Snapshot: <a href="http://asl.serveblog.net:8383/dashboard/snapshot/LlxFSRimTZnD7P5Uyr8Mo4gK3FvMPooB" target="_blank">Click to access Snapshot</a>) where I created a Kubernetes cluster to host my resume, a Python application, and future projects. In this project I used Git Actions as a CI and ArgoCD as a CD. To monitor the 
 luster, I used Prometheus and Grafana. I have experience in monitoring and maintaining Linux servers, creating custom monitoring solutions, and solving infrastructure problems effectively. I also work with cloud platforms like Azure and AWS and manage Terraform execution. Strong problem-solving skills with a focus on improving system stability and making deployments more efficient.
